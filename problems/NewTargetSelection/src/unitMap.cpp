/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. 
 * GHOST is a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of combinatorial 
 * and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP. 
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.
